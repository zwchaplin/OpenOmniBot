This tool enables AI-driven device automation by using a visual language model to understand screen content and perform actions. The agent will:
1. Analyze the current screen state using screenshots
2. Reason about the next best action to achieve the goal
3. Execute UI actions (tap, scroll, input text, etc.)
4. Iterate until the goal is achieved or intervention is needed

Use cases:
- Automate repetitive mobile tasks (ordering food, sending messages, etc.)
- Navigate complex app workflows autonomously
- Extract information from mobile applications
- Perform multi-step operations across different apps

IMPORTANT FOR SUMMARY TASKS:
- If the user's goal is to summarize, extract key points, or produce a report (e.g., "总结/汇总/整理/概括/提炼" or "summary/recap"),
  you MUST set needSummary=true to get the summary back in the tool result.
- When needSummary=true, the final response will include a Summary section and a `summary` field.

BEHAVIOR:
- This tool BLOCKS and waits for the task to complete or require input (up to 2 minutes)
- If the agent needs clarification, the response will include the agent's question
- When you receive a WAITING_INPUT response, use 'task_reply' to answer the agent
- After replying, the tool will again wait for completion or next interaction
- Provide clear, specific goals for best results

WORKFLOW:
1. Call vlm_task with your goal
2. If response shows WAITING_INPUT with a question, call task_reply with your answer
3. Repeat step 2 if the agent asks more questions
4. Task completes when you receive a FINISHED status

Common scenarios:
- Agent asks for verification code: reply with the code
- Agent asks which song to play: reply with the song name
- Agent asks for confirmation: reply '确认' or specific instructions
- Agent needs manual intervention: reply '已完成操作，继续执行' after completing the action

3. Download the file from the returned URL (valid for about 15 minutes).

ACTIONS:
- latest (default): return the most recently received file
- wait: block until a new file arrives (timeoutMs, default 120000)
- list: list recent received files
- get: fetch a file by fileId
- clear: delete one file (fileId) or all files

NOTES:
- Files are stored temporarily on the device (about 2 hours).
- Download URLs are only reachable on the same LAN.
